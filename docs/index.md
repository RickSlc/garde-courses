# About GARDE {-}

This site has been created to provide cancer researchers and genetic counselors with
instruction about GARDE, a population health management application that identifies 
individuals who meet criteria for genetic testing. 

GARDE's architecture is described to facilitate communication and requirements 
for installation and deployment, and user-level instructions are provided to 
facilitate GARDE configuration and operation.


[//]: # (## Important Information about GARDE)
**Important Information about GARDE**

1.  The deployment hosting strategy is determined by the HCS to meet
their unique needs and resources. GARDE staff are available to
consult on this decision as desired.

2.  GARDE does NOT require that patient data leave the HCS. Regardless
of deployment strategy, the entire approach, including all aspects
of the GARDE architecture, is HIPAA compliant for handling PHI.

3.  GARDE has successfully undergone security review and approval at 6
academic medical centers across the US.

**Previous GARDE implementation**

GARDE supported the Broadening the Reach, Impact, and Delivery of
Genetic Services (BRIDGE) randomized controlled trial, which compared
the effectiveness of chatbot-based delivery of cancer genetic services
compared to standard care (SOC) among 3073 unaffected primary care
patients in two large healthcare systems.[^1] The study found that
chatbots are equivalent to SOC in terms of uptake of pretest cancer
genetic services and genetic testing. BRIDGE results suggest that
chatbots offer a scalable and secure way to deliver genetic services,
allowing genetic counselors to focus on more specialized care.
